### Practical

1. Very good!
2. Very good!
3. Good! A few minor things:
- there is no need to ask the user to input anything
- the Fibonacci sequence starts with `1, 1`, not `0, 1`
4. The task was to check a word from user input, but you checked a number that you yourself specified. Your solution for checking if a number is palindromic, is pretty cool, but is not what was required.
6. As a general rule of thumb, remember that you should always understand any code you copy as a safety precaution.

### Notes:
Try to keep your formatting consistent. Give your variables meaningful names and have consistant indentation.
